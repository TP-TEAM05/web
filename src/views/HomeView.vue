            <strong>ReCo</strong> is a team project of a group of students from the Faculty of Informatics and
            Information Technologies of the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava.
            The aim of the project is to create a system for cooperative driving of RC cars.
            The system consists of a server, a web application used for monitoring and giving instructions to the RC
            cars, and receiver nodes in the cars, that gather information from sensors, as well as control the cars
            according to instructions.
